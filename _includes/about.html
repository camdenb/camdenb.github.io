		<h2 class='about-header'>Hey!</h2>
		<p>If you couldn't tell by the obnoxiously large header, my name's Camden.</p>
		<p>I'm currently a Computer Science student at Northeastern University -- a long way from my native Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>A bit about me: I play Ultimate Frisbee, I collect board games, I'm not-so-secretly in love with tuna melts, and I can make a <a target="_blank" href="{{ 'assets/images/fort.jpg' | relative_url }}">killer blanket fort.</a></p>
		<p>I started coding when I was 12, and I never really stopped making <a href="https://www.github.com/camdenb">cool stuff</a>. My career goal is to be a full-stack web developer, and I'm learning slowly but surely. One stack at a time, as I like to say (full disclosure: I've never said that before).</p>
